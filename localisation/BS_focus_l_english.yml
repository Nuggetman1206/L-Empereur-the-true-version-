 brutally_oppress_resistance:0 "Brutally Oppress the Resistance"
 brutally_oppress_resistance_desc:0 "Due to the nature of how the Reichskommissariat was formed, a plethora of resistance groups have been fighting against us from the beginning. Their existence should not be for any longer however, once we begin some effort into crushing these Untermensch groups, and the Ubermensch shall forever reign in the fields of Ukraine."

 contact_nationalist_groups:0 "Contact Nationalist Groups"
 contact_nationalist_groups_desc:0 "It turns out that crushing partisans was a harder task than the Ordnungpolizei had anticipated, and we have suffered some serious losses against the resistance. Recruiting various Ukrainian nationalist groups by promising them Ukraine to fight the resistance would be a win-win for us, plus, who says that we're going to keep that promise?"

 destroy_partisan_groups:0 "Destroy Partisan Groups"
 destroy_partisan_groups_desc:0 "Via lying and war crimes, we have almost crushed all resistance in Ukraine, and all that is left is various insurgent groups in the countryside.

 ukrainian_volunteer_force_desc:0 "The war on the east has exhausted the Reich's Aryan population, and the remainder of Germany's children is being sent to the bulwark against Judeo-Bolshevikism. We should proceed to recruit native Ukrainians to join the security force, via the connections we have to various nationalist groups."

 request_guns:0 "Request Guns"
 request_guns_desc:0 "For us to effectively keep partisans at bay, we require arms, and we lack the capabilities currently to locally produce them. Germany will be willing to assist us with this issue, at a cost.
