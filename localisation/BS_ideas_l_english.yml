The conflict seems to be growing with each month - what will Danzing become, remains yet to be seen."

We want to steer clear of any extremisms and to keep the Polish tradition for as long as possible. However, we are attacked both domestically and abroad for our perceived authoriatarianism, and given the turmoil that the death of Marshall Piłsudski has brought to Poland, it is more important than ever to keep consolidating our regime."
